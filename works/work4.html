<p>I</p>
<p>These ones were angels. The boy’s mother said when they first arrived. Blue eyes and white hair, they were steeped in the color of heaven. He tried to picture heaven in his mind. His father said it was a world covered in metal. O steel beams that cracked the sky in two, and barrel towers that flowed with rice and sugar.

</p>
<p>They descended to his country in seven days after the reds. They reached his village in ten, wearing their metal on their heads and hands. They came in hulking metal trucks that shrieked and growled at him. It had been nearly two years since they drove the Reds out of Taejeon, yet they still carried their metal like it was a part of them. 
</p>
<p>They spoke in a language that only an old reverend in his village could understand. He was one of the few to study close to God, under such angels. They blessed him with a new name, Yohan, to carry along with their tongue. 
</p>
<p>This left the reverend with two names, one from his parents and the other from his God. Yet the boy could not remember the sole name his father had given him. He once tried asking these angels if they could bless him like they did for the reverend. It didn’t have to be one of theirs.  He reasoned, “Just the dirty Korean name would do.”
</p>
<p>Before the white angels were the people of the north. Reds, he always thought it was from the way they shouted. Their voice screamed to the swollen veins of their necks, and it covered them with a blush. Yet his father corrected him that it was a matter of their flag.</p>
<p>The boy found it hard to tell them apart from himself, but for a thick accent and a uniform with a hesitant green that bordered gray and brown. He wondered if that made him a devil. For sharing the same evil eyes that these angels stretched with two pointed fingers to mock. For speaking a dialect that in their ears came off as the same. 
</p>
<p>Were they all, his father and mother, devils as identical north and southerners? Then did God take away his name as punishment? The same God who rewards those close to him with two names, surely would not have a problem with taking his.

</p>
<p>The war came to Taejeon in bullets and fire. It came from both sides in God’s searing metal and the Devil’s red. It came again, but to the children that remained, as a plague in their minds. The act of forgetting was itself a painful fever that scorched but made them new. They would walk aimlessly between stations to guard posts afflicted by this sickness, with no one to call their name. 
</p>
<p>So in his nature, the boy waited by the military checkpoint that stood between the railway to the rest of Taejeon. He stood there every morning looking for a familiar face to point at him and utter his name. He waited there until the late afternoon, right when the tip of the mountain would pierce the lower rim of the sun. He was small and seemed about nine, yet it was hard to tell with the amount he was used to eating. He considered that by evening, no one would be able to notice that he was there. He dictated time this way, merely through the extremes of light and dark. His father did leave behind a wristwatch. A precious silver dowry along with some ivory colored silk that belonged to the boy’s grandfather, but soon tumbled all the way down to him. The boy could not find a use for them. His father was one of the first to die in the war, before ever teaching him how to read the delicate needles that briefly touched the twelve numbers. His mother went in the following months, never once feeling the cool silk glide through her fingers. It would have made for a beautiful dress for his father’s funeral. 
</p>
<p>The last two to utter him. With either affection or hatred, no one after cared to hold his name in their mouths. And one by one, every mind, including the boy’s, erased him from existence. This was how the forgetful plague got to the discarded children. It took their fathers and mothers first as something completely different. And it took them inadvertently after.  
</p>
<p>He did an inventory of each person who came to the checkpoint. The thought of a child in war disgusted them. He would gaze at them, looking for a familiar feature that he could finally rest on. Yet they would look only for a moment before their eyes left him. His presence was cruelty to them. He understood that. Their shameful glances were not of hatred, only guilt. A guilt that reminded them of who they were before the war. As devils were once angels that fell. As the instinct to help was a phantom limb that ached where it was not. 
</p>
<p>His father once said Taejeon stood right in the middle of their country.  He was proud to call it the very heart of the south, as those who wanted to go somewhere would have to pass through its rails. The boy studied each damaged person; his only relation to them was the collective loss that he too wore on his nameless face. Taejeon had become a purgatory for the broken masses. Lost souls would flee from hell up north in Kaesong and Seoul, where the war broke out. And there, they all shared a longing to move deeper into heaven, south in Pusan where it was safest. 

</p>
<p>The boy was a ghost to all of them. A stubborn one that should have gone along with his parents. Even the angels tried to drive him away. There, a momentary thought came to his mind. Who were these angels to stop them from entering the cities within their own country? Devils, ghosts, or not. What good did these angels have for his land that seemed to be tossed around to the next strongest master?  His father said with great wonder that a single out of their fifty states was more than the entire stretch of his country. Even before they decided to cut it in two for their pleasure.</p>
<p>One of the angelss, without a hint of Korean in his mouth, placed his palm right before a man and his daughter, motioning them to stop. With the same hand, he made a square, his index and thumb briefly parting and reuniting. The man pulled out a yellowed paper with a red square stamped in its bottom corner. The paper had six names coupled with six dates of birth, yet he might as well have crossed the other four out with red ink. 
</p>
<p>They ran a metal detector all over the man's body.  Its disc, designed to hover atop dirt, now sniffed at the sack nearly the size of his torso. The man’s daughter sat right on top of it all, her weight but a stalk of hay to the sum total of their lives on his back. How long would it take for her to forget? The boy asked himself. If her father disappeared, then who would be there to speak her name? No one seemed to realize that names and memories were all too fragile.  A blanket adorned with flowers that once shrouded them to sleep, wrapped and held their belongings together, dirtied and stretched to tear. The metal detector beeped in a starving tone at something inside.
“You Americans and your love of metal,” the man said.
</p>
<p>“What kind of monster do you see in me to hide an explosive underneath my own child? Tell me, what good would your weapon serve me, that I would risk it beneath the clothes and books that now hardly remind my daughter that she is indeed a person like you.”
</p>
<p>Yet all they heard in return was resistance, a lashing out from a devil that they could not tell between the regions, from Jeolla tones to their enemy’s thick northern. 
They replaced the metal detector with a rifle and pointed its tip at the man’s daughter and motioned her to the floor. 
</p>
<p>“Down. Everything,” A different angel said in a rough Korean. The words, another in a series of devil speech in their holy ears. The angel called them objects in his Korean language. They kept their bold refusal to learn the words “Man” and “Child.” They had no reason to keep such human words in their arsenal as their business, and with such excellence, was in death. So instead, he resorted to his very words meant to kill. To call them by their greatest past tense, to strip them of their humanity, when they would indeed be lifeless objects. 
</p>
<p>The man and his daughter were nothing but numbers to them. not of a clock face twelve but one of thousands each day that came to stop by the needle of their guns. 
The man undid the tight knots of the blanket that held his life together. A home after an earthquake. A rare breed of tortoise that migrates with heavy footsteps. Not towards fertile summer but away from artillery. 
</p>
<p>He kept it all. A Crumpled pair of shoes, a scuffed wooden box, a pouch of rice, and indeed, the child’s books and clothes laid out for the angels to see. In the middle of this chaos, the culprit was the iron pan that blackened the man’s clothes with soot.   
</p>
<p>The angel used the gun again for communication. He motioned it once and twice upwards, asking the man to stand. Where is the name shop,” he said in the tone of a statement than a question. The man did not understand. Neither did his daughter. Name shop. A new Korean word that the angels made with their own regional dialect. If only such a place existed. Then again, he would not have anything to offer for the precious inheritance.  
</p>
<p>“Abeoji, what is he saying?” She asked her father in confusion. The words echoed into nothing.
“Abeoji, eomeoni”
</p>
<p>Father and mother. The boy tried saying those words aloud. They were empty against his lips. They have been for a while, yet it only dawned on him then. He wondered how long he had lost them. 
“Omma. Apa,” he said it with a blurred face of a man and a woman. He kept digging in his head to find, but only felt their warmth, a momentary teardrop before it dried and cooled to nothing a second after. He tried those words again with more confidence, as if that would bring with them their names. He tried to picture them in their room. Behind the wooden-framed doors, checkered with paper, some finger-sized punctures in those about and below his height.
</p>
<p>The boy rushed home in a panic. He tried to figure out what else he had lost. Desperate to patch over the tears and damages in his past, yet unaware all the same of what was spilling out of him. He looked at his parents’ bedroom to be sure that the holes were really there. He felt its rims with the careful edges of his hand, making sure not to widen them further. He pointed his finger through the hole, the perfect culprit, though even that memory of ever making it was lost in him. The boy’s room only belonged to him with a day-to-day lease of a fresh memory in waking up there each morning. It was empty but for a cotton-stuffed mattress that he folded in a diligent routine. He wasn't sure yet again of which parent instilled this civility in his otherwise ungoverned life. He then examined the beige walls in the living room. Pale rectangles in place of photographs, with only nails and dust-covered adhesives to point out what was missing. They looked like the rough borders of an unfinished map. Islands and countries, empty without names, without meaning. As if to say that they were open for anyone to claim.
</p>
<p>The remainder of his house made up the bare bones, where it dissolved to a mere place for him to sleep each night. He maintained the faintest recollection of the Reds coming in and asking for food before the angels arrived. They left with boxes, the picture frames under their armpits, and one of them wearing an out-of-place silver watch. He could spend a lifetime searching, yet he knew he would not get an inch closer to ever finding these belongings. He surmised that one of them had taken his family’s identification card as well. The angels kept careful watch over the Reds, disguising themselves as civilians. Perhaps it lay flattened in a back pocket of their uniforms. Or underneath a layer of dust in a box that they never got around to opening. The boy thought of the possibility that one of them, a stranger he had only met then, was living disguised as his father. He wondered if the soldier realized that he could be the sole person who had his name in his hands. He could burn that piece of paper to start a fire, or be buried with it, as war goes, and the boy would simply vanish with him. 
</p>
<p>He returned to his room, worried he might forget that it belonged to him. There he prayed to the God that took his name to let his ignorance engulf him. For its numbness to flow through his legs, as they were tender from standing still the whole day, and to fill his stomach, which growled at him like a puppy. He prayed again, creasing his eyes, for his forgetfulness to come to him entirely or not at all.  He held on to what he remembered but all the same, he was too tired to be frozen in the middle, between the unanswerable heaven and hell.
</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The sky was an ink blotch of dark blue when he woke up. He felt the same sore and hunger from the night before. He dreamt of his parents, yet like any cruel dream, they faded only to a lingering taste of what he had lost. 
</p>
<p>Reliving the same dream was a battle he waged each morning. He grasped at it like air, knowing that it was good while feeling its colors bleach out of his mind.   
His hunger hit him again. The railway would open when the rest of the sun showed. So the boy walked to the pine forest behind his house to look for food. He had tasted every bark and every sparse creature in those woods. He was certain that nothing alive remained except for the trees. They were indifferent to it all. Angels or northern troops, long winters and dry summers alike. With just the shed of their needle leaves, they passed from one crisis to the next. He felt a kinship in their practice of letting go and forgetting. 
</p>
<p>Instinct guided him through the patternless columns that soon blurred away his house and surrounded him. He would walk deeper each time, until the faintest sense of familiarity was lost in him. He looked for mushrooms at the base of the trees or within the shade of damp boulders. The occasional mugworth would burn into his empty stomach, but he ate it nonetheless with porridge that was more water than rice. He walked further, until the narrow bald path mended into decaying leaves and moss patches.  He felt the rough shell of the tree like an old wound before carving out the soft insides of its bark. He put them all in a pouch that once felt the weight of coins pull at its base. 

</p>
<p>The color of the sun began to show, and the boy was exhausted. He could only ignore it for so long before its urge was greater than hunger. He wanted to be one in those thousand pine trees, with no fruits to tempt any travelers, nor branches for birds to nest. He wished for sunlight to strengthen him, not peel at his skin. He wanted to down a pale of water only to feel nourished after, rather than the urge to hurl it back out of his mouth. 
</p>
<p>He kept his pace, foraging for the precious strength he would need to walk back. There was a thin drizzle that wisped his hair gray and cooled against his skin. It urged him to stand beneath a tree. 
The boy was no longer sure of where to go and there he caught a glint from a faded window. He took a closer look and the rest of the structure began to develop around. It was a shack that was mostly wood with a makeshift roof made up of straw and tin. It blended into the stone wall right behind it. There was an old metal sign that clung onto a pair of nails on each of its sides. From the paint-chipped gaps where rust swelled out like mold, it read,  “Label Market.”
</p>
<p>He thought it was a stationary store that was abandoned along with the schools and universities. It could remain there for a decade, and no one would notice its existence. 
He walked towards the shop, trying to find meaning in its odd location deep in the woods. He felt a strange pull coming from the structure, faint enough that only the aimless and empty-minded like him could ever notice.   
</p>
<p>The doorknob was a decaying green. His feet felt the straws and dirt grains mill against the floor. There were no bells that greeted him, only a dimness his eyes were trying to adjust to. It was the same opaque black of the soot he would try to wipe at the hem of his shirt. The same ones that clung to the walls of his house when the war first broke out. It lingered until a deep incandescent bulb flushed the shop. It was the same orange seeping through the veins of shut eyelids against the angels’ flashlights. They’d ask if he was North or South. Yet it was also the orange of dried persimmons in autumn. Its sweetness hard to forget. 
</p>
<p>The walls were made up of a mismatched series of shelves. Some were wooden, others that rattled with steel frames. They were filled with items lost and discarded. Objects that were once held by more personal hands. He saw on his right, a stack of Bibles in both Korean and English. Another shelf lined up a small legion of combat helmets. Some had nets, others had bullet holes. A host of other objects came to his vision. Crates of military goods and candies from America, spam and other foods encased in metal, toys in plastic and cotton, next to a rainbow of cigarette boxes and liquor bottles. Baby clothes, bluntly mountained and tossed into one corner. Its tragedy, lost after the first few sets. On the other side of the store, the boy saw whole picture frames, facing sideways against each other to fit in the suffocating gap. In its rusted nail hook, a tangled ball of dog tags caught his eye. Each flat metal piece was once assigned a neck to hang onto. A neck that beaded with sweat and pulsed with blood. The most basic sign of life. 
</p>
<p>They were all condemned souls, waiting to be rescued in their rat king knot. It dawned on him that the angel from the other day was perhaps talking about this place that indeed sold names, among several other assortments.
</p>
<p>“Who’s there?” A woman spoke from the other end. Her voice carried a dignified tone that believed its own lie. A voice that said everything in the shop belonged to her. The engraved names of each angel, the helmets that tried to protect their soldiers, the stone-faced portraits of families that were encased in a time before war. 
The boy approached the counter to find the owner sitting atop her discarded treasure. She held a baby, her son, against half her bare chest. The boy could not help but look at him. He stood there, mesmerized by each single detail that was so foreign to him.  He wondered if all babies were born with such translucent hair. As if the blackness that covered his strands were a product of age.
</p>
<p>They were golden and captured the light with the smallest movement of his head. Only then, he realized that the baby’s father must be an angel. A father who came to his land with a rifle, meant to kill countless, some even bearing the mother’s surname. Yet all the same, he produced a life. 
The boy looked at the woman again. A mother who reaped from her husband’s outcome, who robbed and sold, but gave everything back to her son. They lay tangled together, with their son on both extremes of angel and devil, violence and love. His very proof of life was blood that flowed against the deep current of the war.
</p>
<p>Each digit of his arms, defined by a round layer of fat, and his skin a pastel white and pink like a Japanese fish cake. He was still tiny. The weight of his entire life rested on her forearm, unblemished by time, without a memory to be stolen. 
</p>
<p>Her son had his own kind of forgetfulness. It was enviable to let the war pass him by under his mother’s shade. To rely utterly on her combat ration filled breasts to nurture him until he could walk.
“What do you want boy? And mind your voice, my son needs to sleep.”
“How much would it cost to buy my name?” The boy asked, prepared to give her what little he had.
</p>
<p>“If you know what’s good for you, you should just leave. It will be light as you don’t even have your name to carry. This one right here-” And she patted her son’s head. “I'm stuck here because of him.”
</p>
<p>He had never been this far. He considered the remaining distance to leave Taejeon behind, it tempted him. It was just his house and the guard post. Nothing close to nostalgia remained, as everything else was either destroyed or forgotten. There was an old saying about these woods that echoed in his head. No one was truly lost unless they saw the same tree twice. It was to caution against circling around, but it took on a different meaning for him. He felt as if he entered each second anew, never lingering on a single memory that phased through him only to be forgotten. He wanted to be like the half-American baby infront of him. If not for a mother, at least to be free with ignorance. He could turn his back on it all, and the mist from the rain would slowly dissolve Taejeon. His forgetfulness would be kind like a scar, where skin was no longer just that. Because a scar meant the body was parted to the bone and disfigured. But a scar also meant its refusal to bleed. 
</p>
<p>The thought of walking endlessly without knowing where, to find something instead of standing still and waiting. The thought of what could be in front of his very instance or the next. Yet he was only built to be aimless for so long. Those raindrops outside that felt the sky were bound to crash and shatter into a hundred. To wreck itself and seep into the earth. 
</p>
<p>He asked the woman again what it would cost him for three names, the price of a family. 
She pulled out a box from under the counter, as if there were others that asked for the same thing.
“Only your real names as replacement.” She answered but the boy ignored her reading through each identification card of lost and dead families. Just names next to dates, a red stamp to make it official. An empty seal of approval from abandoned government offices that never once belonged to them. He skimmed the papers, reading them for a moment before they were left forgotten again in the box. He found one with three names: a mom, a father, and a son. He picked it up, expecting it to feel heavier than paper. He picked it as if assigning a stranger’s name to his mother would bring her back to him. The woman told him to leave as there was nothing left in the shop that he could afford.

</p>
<p>The boy walked through the forest, repeating the names of his new family. Clenching it with his mind as he held the paper in his hands. He found the tree that he carved for food. He took a closer look at it to see that only a blemish remained where it had mended itself new. He realized then that he was lost, no longer certain where his home was.

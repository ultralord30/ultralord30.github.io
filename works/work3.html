<p>NO one cried for his mother on the day she died. The sky that morning, in its permanent gray, decided to remain dry. It was January 1952, the lowest point of winter. Two years since the war broke out. There was no struggle or any words. She seemed to have fallen between the cracks of war, with only Mingu to mourn her. Yet no matter how hard he squeezed in himself, he could not muster a single tear. He found her in the bedroom, under a patchworked blanket drowned up to her nose. She was facing away from the door. Away from him. As if her body alone could feel shame. It was the blanket she received in her marriage. A family heirloom, beaten, wrung out, and sown together a thousand times. Everything else in her room was as it was. A single wooden cross on a yellowed wall, her bedding laid out on the floor, and a framed picture of his father next to a paper lamp. 
</p>
<p>He always thought of her by the smell of her hands. The faint sting of the detergent, or the earthy potatoes that lingered between her nails. Yet there was a pale and awful stench as he walked closer to her. His mouth was as dry as his eyes. He felt a shock building up to his chest like puke. It became the last smell he could remember her by. He locked eyes with the stern, frozen expression of his father. Its black and gray eyes trailed him as if expecting him to cry.
 	Mingu closed her door in the slightest whisper before bolting out of the house. His bare feet began to numb against the half-frozen soil. He didn't care about the broken splinters and glass shards from the raids before. He didn't care about stepping on gasoline rainbow puddles.</p>
<p>He ignored the olive-colored trucks carrying a legion of GIs. Blonde, black, all mushroom topped. He could never tell one from the other. They’d laugh at his broken English at the cost of a chocolate bar. He sometimes offered a piece to his mom, with the unspoken assurance she’d decline. ‘I already ate’ seemed the easiest line he fell for. Mingu wondered then if his mother ever tried chocolate. Or if she was afraid she might like it too much. He wondered what the last thing she ever ate was, if she enjoyed that meal or if she died hungry. </p>
<p>It didn't matter where he was going. He simply was.

</p>
<p>MINGU learned not to ask for much, especially once the war broke out. He understood the charm in scarcity. That in return, the things he received tasted all the sweeter. He felt a sense of comfort in his family being close to the dirt. If god forbid, something happened to them, they wouldn't end up falling too far. At the end of the day, he'd still sleep in the living room, close to the wall separating the kitchen where it was warmest. Sprawled in his stretch of straw mats on heated floors, he couldn't care less if he had a bad day or not. He’d hold it all in, just to let himself spill in the evening.

</p>
<p>Every few months all the kids would line up at an old gymnasium in his village in Daejeon. It was the only place big enough to fit them. It was originally a gift from the party members, of goodwill to foster health and the like. The sentiment remained, except it was repurposed for disease control. It started out with a single portrait of President Rhee in the center of the hall. One by one, pictures of local government figures and propaganda posters began to replace the sporting equipment. They jumped between themes of broken hammers and sickles to soldiers in red portrayed as dokkebis or other evil spirits. Mingu averted his eyes from them, fearing that he might get possessed and become a commie himself. 
 	Medical white partitions ran across the middle of the hall, separating the boys and the girls. He hugged his mother before going in. The men stripped him clean, down to his underwear. The nurse began searching every inch of his body for bug bites. They’d always stop for a moment at the small of his back. 
</p>
<p>“It’s a birthmark ma’am,” Mingu said. 
He had never seen it himself but it was a red splotch in the shape of an island. He became the pride of his family after a village shaman told his father that it symbolized fortune.  
She tried to scratch it off his skin. Her rubber gloves pretending to be an eraser. To no avail, she let him go. 
</p>
<p>Like cattle, he was pulled to his next stop. A different nurse this time placed him atop a chair. Mingu knew what was to come. So much so he did not bother fixing his hair that morning. He studied the comb in the nurse's hand. It resembled a fish bone with needle-like teeth that poked through both sides. She began rummaging through his hair for lice. She’d lay clumps of them at a time on her palm before slowly gliding it from the base. She'd go back between sections of his head repeating a process that only a mother could have the patience for.  
</p>
<p>She clicked her tongue a couple of times before speaking, “Now be honest dear, how often do you wash?” Her frustration caught up. 
Mingu looked at the clipper holstered in her pocket. 
“Every other day ma’am. My mother makes sure” it was worth a try. There was an even greater divide in the gymnasium. Not between boys and girls but between rich and poor. As if she caught his lie in her very hands, she placed the fine comb directly to his face. There, he saw what looked to be white specks within the blur of his eyes. Slowly his vision adjusted to tiny legs and eyes that grew out from them. She then showed a whole other village in her cupped hand. These nurses and doctors always made it a point to remind him of his place. He always wondered why they fussed about these creatures. As if they had nothing better to worry about. He had ants that burrowed their place in his house. They'd show up like clockwork every spring and summer but no one seemed to mind. 
. 
</p>
<p>The nurse shook her head before the clipper buzzed to life. It ran through his hair like silk. It took her mere minutes to cut down all the hair he had grown over the months. A senseless destruction at the landscape of his scalp. He almost felt bad for the lice. He wondered how long they had been alive. Or how they ended up on him. They simply existed, albeit a seldom itch. He felt a dirty sense of irony at that moment. For a nurse, it looked too easy for her to destroy.
</p>
<p>Everything felt so fragile to him then. The old building looked like it could collapse in on itself. The clipper was composed in all its labyrinth of wires and gears,  encased in plastic. Yet Mingu felt he could break it with a single throw. He looked at the boy next to him. What was stopping him from hurting that boy? A pair of scissors, and even the chair he was sitting on.  It was all that easy for the nurse to deal her violence to his scalp.  He could not understand why but he felt a sudden urge to cry. He felt it climbing out from his chest to the edge of his throat. He felt his eyes sting and his face warm up but his father taught him better than that. He instead focused on the pinpricks of hair that fell against his bare skin. He placed a hand on the dome of his head, feeling all the familiar grooves and angles that were once covered. He could not wait to go home. To sleep and be well again. But for now, he swallowed it all like a marble. 
</p>
<p>At the other end of the gymnasium, it was his turn at the exterminator. 
“Park Mingu?” the masked man read from a list.
"Yes sir,” Mingu straightened himself. His father also taught him to look men in the eyes when speaking to them. He motioned to one of the black tape X marks on the ground. All the boys began to form themselves next to him. Some with hair, and others, closer to the ground like Mingu. 
“Now close your eyes and hold your breath,” he said under his mask. 
</p>
<p>The man produced a nozzle from the back of his table.  It resembled a syringe but he held it slanted in two hands like a rifle. As if giddy for his turn at violence, he pointed it at Mingu’s face. The pesticide came in a thick cloud and settled on his shoulders. The man worked through his arms, legs, and under his neck, making sure his killing was thorough. Yet Mingu felt it oddly pleasant against his skin. He wanted snow to feel that way. Like a kind powder that cools but does not burn, and numbs without teeth.  

</p>
<p>THAT night Mingu helped his mother with dinner. It was a gray area in his family where his father deemed it a feminine duty. He had his fears of his son not turning out to be a proper man. Yet there was something about the  kitchen that always seemed to charm him. He loved the way his mother brought it to life with a single matchstick under the clay stove. Soon enough the whole kitchen would warm up, sending its heat underneath the floors like blood through vein. He saw a harmony where the entire house would die, the same way his family would without his mother’s food. He loved watching her work. He realized that day, there were so many different tools to kill. A gun for a soldier, a clipper for a nurse, and even something as gentle as pesticide. Yet his mother did everything with just a butcher’s knife. She’d crack an egg with the dull of its back, or a can of military meat in two swift motions. She’d crush seeds with its hilt or raise it above her head to cut through bone. 
</p>
<p>At the dinner table, his mother smelled of garlic and chicken stew. She haggled for nearly an hour that morning. All she got for it was barely an adolescent hen. Mingu felt an odd sense of guilt but the bird looked to be far dead even before his mother asked for it.  He waited by the door for his father to return from the factory.  Mingu bowed a full ninety degrees before aligning his father’s shoes. He studied Mingu and the film of sweat covering his shaved head. He smelled of chemicals when he walked in and rice wine when he opened his mouth. “Were you just in the kitchen?”  His finger pointed like a gun. Mingu could not answer but looked down instead. </p>
<p>“I needed his help today dear. We got home quite late.” A kinder voice replied for him. 
“How was work?” she tried to change the subject and motioned for her husband to join her. Mingu placed a sitting cushion at the head of the table. His father’s bones creaked from wear as he bent down to the floor. “Your son needs to learn.” He usually had more to say, but an ominous silence weighed him that night. His mother could feel it too. He waited for his father to pick up his spoon, and dissect the chicken that was still boiling in its stone pot. A weak leg each for the men, and the neck, his mother’s favorite. Mingu waited for his father to take his first bite before he even dared to touch his spoon. He finally bit into his share. getting everything from skin, meat, cartilage, and vein, until there was only bone. He may cook and cry a lot, but he at least ate like a man. His father cleared his throat and a shock ran through his body in reaction.  He looked up at him, heat steaming from his mouth. He then looked down at the empty bowl in his father’s hand. “I'm sorry sir,” Mingu said before he poured the rice wine with two unsteady hands.  He looked to his mother for help again. A woman’s voice of reason. Yet before she could speak, his father’s palm tasted of green peppers at the side of his face. Where the pain was nothing at first, until it slowly crept and soon overwhelmed him. Then it tasted like salt and metal. Blood in the inner cheek of his mouth.
</p>
<p>Mingu was not a man. This was twice that he wanted to cry in one day. But doing so would further upset him. “You do not hurt my son at my table!” His mother exclaimed and went to him. He could never get used to the sound of metal spoons and chopsticks hitting the table.
“Are you okay dear?” she asked. She checked his face for bruises. “Open your mouth, let me see,” This only made it harder for him to hold his tears. He looked at the bowl, the wine half gone by then. He studied its tempting milkish white color. But he knew what it really tasted of.  He was not a man, so he lapped at his cheeks instead like a wounded dog. He felt the cut in him, crooked in the shape of his teeth. 
</p>
<p>“Go back to your food. He needs to be a man” he ordered. 
“What is wrong with you? He is just a child” In place of more arguing, his father sighed instead. It was nothing like him. The rest of the dinner was silent. 
He wanted nothing more than to sleep, and let it pass through. He swallowed it all, blood, food and emotions like a marble. 


</p>
<p>THAT was the night his father was drafted into the war. His turn at violence. An odd tragedy seemed to orbit his family. No rain and tears for his mother’s death, and at thirty, his father barely made the cutoff.  A party official dressed in a clean black suit came to the factory where he worked to read through a list of names that were to receive a physical and an oversized green uniform soon after. He was the only man there who could afford to wear the very fabric that the factory produced. Daejeon sat right in the middle of the country, and it was only a matter of time before the war came to them. The party official left in his jeep, perhaps to read another list of names at a different factory. </p>
<p>The last memory he gave to his father was of him crying. On the day he left, Mingu cried harder than all the times when his father used to beat him. He tried to keep it to himself, or at least wait for him to properly leave. Yet everything came out of him like he was vomiting.  His father raised a hand, making him wince in reaction. But he placed it heavy and gentle on his son’s shoulder. “Son, a man can only cry three times in his entire life. Once when he is born, and the other two are for his parents' funeral.” It was a cruel law he had heard a hundred times. But this one felt different. He looked up at him. His father’s eyes were red. Up until then, he held a terrifying respect for him. His mother once told him that people from his father’s generation were made of stone. That they came from a more cruel time. She assured Mingu that he loved him, but he just never learned how to move his face the right way. He realized then how weak his father was. He saw the fear, in an odd twist of his face. Mingu did not know how to react. Was this how his father felt, each time he saw his son cry.? Perhaps then his violence came from confusion. Not from disgust or anger. The Park family men stood side by side, as bald as newborns and crying like women. 
</p>
<p>Mingu cried the hardest when his father died in the following year. There was a mortar, and he did not suffer. That was what his comrades told his mother. Two soldiers at the door that smelled of smoke and gunpowder, in place of one that stung of chemicals and rice wine. They saluted her instead of bowing.
</p>
<p>Nearly a week has passed since her death. As selfish as he was he cried one too many times that he had nothing left for her. The soldiers carried her to the back of their truck. They were all stone-faced like his father. As if it were just another day for them. They didn't call her by her name, nor as ma’am, nor as Mingu’s mother. They addressed her simply as a body. “Place the body on the seat,” they said. Or “We will release the body to a hospital.” This apathy seemed to be a side effect of dealing in violence. No bows, no salutes, but just a sack of rice. He finally understood why his father hit him every time he cried. It was like tea. With each scalding tear, he got a little fainter. Until he was nothing but dry leaves, steeped of all flavor. 

</p>
<p>THE entire house died with his mother. He tried lying in his corner of the living room each night to let it pass, but sleeping never felt the same. There was an air of coldness, and he was always starving. Even with the shards of coal he gathered and placed in the clay stove, he could never bring his house to life. There, the kitchen looked like a careless idea of one with only its bare bones showing. A stove on one side, empty shelves, and a butcher’s knife collecting dust. He never noticed until then how old that knife was. This was the one tool he thought was unbreakable by the way his mother wielded it.  He approached it in a manner of respect and held its weight against his hands. Mingu felt the grooves in its handle and thought of how his mother once held it. Part of him hoped that her warmth still lingered within its wood grains. Just like everything else around him, it was cold. 
</p>
<p>He opened the sack that remained sitting outside his house. The soldiers left it there. Their form of condolences.  He looked inside to see that the rice bugs had gotten to it before him. He watched his mother cook nearly every day to know how to get rid of them. He just had to soak it in water and watch their bodies float. He found it funny that none of them tried to climb out of the sack. They were grouped into tiny clumps. Some bigger than the rest, and others in threes like his family was. They reminded him of the lice that were living on his head. He imagined each of these bugs as nurses and soldiers. He saw them as fathers, mothers, and crying children. perfectly happy and clueless in their world. Who was he really, to play God? To be utterly surrounded by food and in the warmth of another. He could not bring himself to play his turn at violence. He wanted what they had. 
</p>
<p>He grabbed his mother’s blanket instead of her warmth and wrapped it around himself. It was the last thing she ever touched and that was the most he could ask for. All Mingu could do then was to lie down. Across the straw mats that once flowed with warmth, he rubbed away at the bitter cold. He felt the blanket, all its stitches and holes covered in different fabrics. He noticed an old square of his mother’s shirt patched flat into the blanket. He found another, of his father’s handkerchief that once wiped at Mingu’s nose. He felt a familiar touch of his old school uniform. Far before the war, when his country was warmest even in winter.  He felt another fabric, and one more after that. He tried to piece together their stories until he fell asleep and let it pass.

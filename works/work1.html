  <p>The year is 1999. An entire nation celebrates four days ahead of Christmas. South Korea’s first satellite took the stars. Aptly named Arirang-1, or my beloved one, the country cheers as their first son leaves off to see the world. </p>
  <p>Nine days before the millennium's turn, my mother stocks up on baby formulas. There is a pit in her stomach, for she expects the worst. As one turned to two and 99 to 00, the nation remembered that the world was ending. </p>
  <p>I was born three months later, in March. It was the year of the dragon, but I felt nothing close to one. The first son of a Korean family, a crying rage of plum complexion, and like Arirang, a beloved one. So beloved, my mother remembers my life from the beginning to now, from birthdays to soccer goals, cataloged in VCR tapes and yellowed photographs. In the same way, I could remember the time I spent in her womb, t-minus 9 months from birth. I was blind, muffled, but warm. It made no difference whether I closed my eyes or not. There was a kind of peace that I now long for when I sleep. I could remember the flush of cold buckwheat noodles she craved and the pickles she had right after. I could remember the uproar of my father, through my mother’s stomach, watching the live broadcast of the launch. 
</p>
  <p>My mother talked about how easy it felt for her to walk after I was born. So, I wonder if Earth got lighter when Arirang Hyung took off. I often think I’ve inherited many of her fears from the Y2k. Did he carry the same fear of the world when he left?
</p>
  <p>I cried harder than I ever did in my lifetime for being dragged out of my mother’s womb. So it only makes me wonder if he even wanted to go to the stars. With my eyes open, I could not distinguish between the stars and my three-month older brother in the sky. One seemed to blend perfectly into the other, yet I always felt a lonely sympathy for him. </p>
  <p>In half my baby pictures, my mother dressed me in bows as big as my head and strawberry prints in pink. This was against my father’s wishes. “He will be confused when he grows up,” he used to say. “I wouldn’t mind having a second daughter,” my mother would then consider. Up until I was born, doctors were not allowed to disclose the gender of the baby. It was either that or selective abortions for a proper chance at a male heir. A small evil in lieu of a larger one. A son, a possibility of one, protects the daughter. Yet it was my older sister who always seemed to protect me. “You owe a great deal to her.” my family reminds me. It was my sin that she was born a daughter, two years too close to me. Greedy, I ended up receiving twice my mother’s love meant for both of us while I cried and lamented my birth. More than anything, I was a boy, and I was new. Indeed, a beloved one. 
</p>
  <p>In March 2001, I was born again, exactly a year after my birth. My mother’s hands smelled of peeled potatoes and onions. She placed them against my philtrum to see if I was breathing. I continued to sleep. My peach fuzz was used to her smell. At one year of age, a milestone, a whole cycle, it was the last time she ever checked if I was breathing. There was no longer a need as I was past the stage where babies used to die. Good names were not wasted back then. It was a gift that came with the assurance of life. It still filled her with the same wash of relief as my breath moistened her fingertips a final time. That afternoon, a celebration was held in my name. No, of my cycle. “Sungwon will be having his Doljabi in a couple of months,” my uncle told my mom. “Make sure to bring Seung along.” He was blushing, giddy with the stench of soju. After the dragon came the year of the snake. It felt like a whole nest of them surrounded me in my Dol celebration.  
</p>
  <p>My mother placed me on the head of the table at the very center of the event hall. She then blended into the crowd of relatives and family friends. It was my celebration, yet around me were fruits and sweet rice cakes that I had no teeth to chew with. I saw myself as the only meat on the table, plump from a year’s worth of breast milk.  I was alone to fend for myself, a lamb to the slaughter. </p>
  <p>Before me, I saw the strangest assortment of items. An abacus, a stethoscope, a pencil, a two-dollar bill, and an encyclopedia. My life set out for me in five different careers, yet each felt like another flavor of a dead end. I was to pick one of these items, the entire clan cheering me on to dig my own grave.  I looked at them in great contemplation before kicking all my future away in a rage. A laughter broke out. 
</p>
  <p>And in return, words came out of me unlabored as spiteful crying. I cursed each of them for celebrating something I never once asked for. Yet it only seemed to amuse them. There weren't any words to mold against my lips, to fling with my tongue. To tell them how I felt except for my tears. I searched for my mother in the crowd that formed around me. The only person to truly understand my crying. I tried to maneuver the cruel weight of my head that my body had yet to catch up to. All the emotions crammed up there to torment me. They looked down at me, smiling at my stature. I bargained for the silence of my crib. The warmth of being swaddled against my mother’s back. Yet, at that moment, I longed for nothing more than her womb. My sweetest state of limbo. Not a desire to die but to quit living. My uncle forced the two-dollar bill into my clenched hand. 
</p>
  <p>“As long as he makes a ton of money,” he said with the same alcoholic chuckle. He must’ve held a shot glass at his Doljabi. </p>
  <p>I returned home that evening defeated, yet in my mother's arms. Perhaps I looked ungrateful in her eyes. I knew nothing but to be miserable. Not only of my life but also of her’s ending. I thought about how, in another life, she never had to carry me. How she never had to sneak out in the dead of winter to buy baby formula. She never had to destroy her body for me or her dreams. She held a paintbrush at her Doljabi yet became a mother instead. I wonder who bore the greater sin. A mother who gave birth to a miserable son, or a son who was so ungrateful of his own birth. To impose a warm life at times, but ultimately with all its inevitable suffering. I felt we were held there, a pair of doorknobs that locked on both ends. My existence kept her from becoming anything but a mother, and she’s trapped me in life.
</p>
  <p>There was a cruelty in being a parent. In the making and raising of a child. How one would fatten up a cow to drink from its milk and soon kill for its flesh. It didn’t matter how dense the pasture was or how clean its barn was. It always comes with a conscience of taking. My life was not a happy birth. My mother labored for nine months carrying me, and even more so in the hours before I got evicted out of her womb. The doctor ran a blade across her lower stomach, and it has been a debt I owe. There was a cost for every diaper change and every hospital visit when I turned a slighter blush of red. A labor of love was still labor, after all. I looked at my ancestry and saw a family tree of farmers. They were in the business of sowing the womb and reaping its reward twenty or so years later. 
</p>
  <p>“I am retiring this March,” my father said at the dinner table. His words sat heavy next to the pollack roe.“Don't you think it’s time for you to step up?” My family’s expectations seemed to grow impatient. I looked down at the pinkish fish eggs clustered in their sack. I wanted to be one in that endless school of unfulfilled potential. Soon to be dined on before ever learning how to swim. It was that wretched two dollars I clenched on my first birthday. The sweat on my palm seeped into the bill as if I had then signed a contract with my family. My mother said, “When your father was your age, he already began paying for your grandparents’ bills.” My mind unglued from my food, I looked up at my father. He seemed excited to have his turn at being the farmer instead of the cow. Perhaps what he saw in return was hesitation, fear, or any range of emotions that he, too, felt at my age. What I had instead was pity. I found myself studying the remnants of the cow in my father. The way he was picked utterly clean to exhaustion. I saw the age lines that kept digging into his face, I saw his stature, once proud, now bent close to the ground. He looked as if he was moments from death, searching for a grave hidden somewhere beneath the dirt. Yet there was also a careful relief simmering out of his face. It only foretold how hard my life has yet to be. He must’ve felt miserable to enjoy taking the leash off his neck and clasping it around mine. To find comfort instead of anguish in my suffering. I saw the wreckage of a man in front of me. I saw what my life meant, and I also saw death. I saw into my future, and he looked back with a dentured saccharine smile. 
</p>
  <p>That evening, I was flat silent in my bed. Under a thick blanket, I could almost emulate the warmth I felt twenty-four years ago. Yet I was now riddled with consciousness, no longer a beloved one. I was fixed on a slight gap between the window and the curtain.  A bluish hue leaked into my room from the highrise next to my father’s apartment. It stood tall, a behemoth over us that devoured half the sky. It was the company where my father labored for the past two decades. I wonder how he felt, having his work loom over him like that, even in the safety of his own home. Atop the building, the company tagline glowed white. “Life’s Good,” it insisted. Those words felt empty next to the equally absent sky, one half covered like a thumb against the moon and the other a barren pitch black. I always thought that if I looked at the sky long enough, I might unknowingly glimpse Arirang -1. With each passing year, there were fewer and fewer stars at night. I used to see the three diagonal specks of Orion's belt and tell between Ursa major and minor. 
</p>
  <p>I felt guilt that the mother bear was half made up of her womb in the four points of a square. Before being a bear, she was Calisto, a beautiful huntress.  Yet there was sin that turned her into a beast, such as my mother’s. Having a child. I think about what could’ve been if it wasn't for her son Arcas. He was Calisto’s undoing twofold as he nearly slayed the bear that used to be his mother.  I could not help but see the same in my mother’s fate as I  am the product of her greatest sin and her failure. I wonder what Arcas thought at that moment, with his miserable four-point star head. Was he so labored by its weight, to try and kill his own mother? Or perhaps it was simply the labor of being born. I looked to the sky, and it was empty, muddled with city lights and a mocking crescent moon that smiled down at me. 
</p>
  <p>Even an utterly infinite heaven was in decay. So, what chance did I stand? I mapped out my life as an offshoot copy of my father. In ten years, my hair will thin out. In twenty, my cholesterol will betray me. In thirty years, I'll grow liver spots on my face. My heart was a time bomb, my back a centipede, and my stomach, a balloon. It was only a matter of time before I saw which gave out first. Like a labyrinth, wrinkles will run across my body, growing with each passing second. Ariadne’s thread unspooled before my eyes from the tip of my umbilical cord. I was frightened of finding the other end hidden beneath my life. Yet I could not dare look away, only to be conscious that the beast I was meant to slay was not a minotaur but myself. I examined every inch and fiber of my life laid behind me. I wanted to trace it back into my mother’s womb. I wanted my labyrinth to mend into baby-smooth skin again. Only a slow death awaited me as I continued to unwind my thread. My mother and father, was I more to them than simple livestock? I let that thought sit at the edge of my throat like an urge to cry. I considered my own retirement in however many years it would take to pay off my filial debt to them. What then? Was I to raise my own son like a cow to slaughter? To dig his marrow for broth and use his pelt for warmth when mine would then be thinned from use. A thousand shares of him sold as morsels for my gain. No, I came to a resolution. I committed the sin of being an ungrateful son. I would not dare commit another of being a parent. 
</p>
  <p>
I looked to the stars a final time for in a couple of months, I would stoop like my father. My bones would calcify to a permanent 90-degree bow, submitting to my drawn-out grave. I tried to find Ariang Hyung, yet all I could do was stare at the same emptiness my parents raised me under. Perhaps it was best for Arirang to fade into it. I wanted him to fly further into space, away from Earth, hoping he would find himself in the center of Calisto’s womb. A perfect retirement.  I wanted it to feel like he was falling back to the same sleep he had before his birth. To not feel anything but warmth. There, he could thaw out his bones from cold consciousness and mend his eyes shut, for they were nothing but open wounds that refused to close. I wanted Arirang -1 to fade slowly into the womb. No thoughts but broken images that flash in his memory.  Floating in the empty vacuum, in amniotic fluid. It was almost as if I was there with him, before my first birthday, before the space launch. I saw us before a man, a space junk, a satellite, a fetus.

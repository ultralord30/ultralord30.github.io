<p>I remember a lecture on genealogy in my 11th-grade biology class. Every one of us, ideally, has 46 chromosomes, a donation of 23 from the mother and the other half from the father. That is why parenting is akin to love. A series of instructions that dictate my facial features, height, and whether I could curl my tongue or have double-jointed thumbs. Yet that was the only detail I inherited from my father.
</p>
<p>I felt his callused palm scratch against me on our climb to Seorak Mountain when I was five. There was a campsite in one of its lower slopes where the men of our family gathered at the end of each year. I did not mind the rough edges of his hand, the same way he calmly tolerated when I stretched his thumb to his wrist. Then I would do the same with my hands. An arbitrary sense of belonging that soon became the only connection to me being his son. I find myself looking into the mirror, trying to spot the blueprints of my father that were supposed to manifest years ago. His height, his strength, a stature of any degree. I waited for those signs like a framework, to help me build around a sense of confidence, or even his love for the province. They were left discarded at the bottom of my gene pool, if it was there at all. Instead, I was born with my mother’s weak arms. A dog that knew a single trick of thumb onto wrist.</p>
<p>My father began to feel my same concern. A growing disdain for my lack of manhood. There was no way for him to dictate that I was a man other than the organ that sat awkwardly between my legs. How was he to love me when I rejected all the qualities that he was so proud of himself in? He lifts my sister with one arm, my mother with two. Yet as his son, a male heir, I was to carry his name, and take care of them when he dies.
</p>
<p>At 17, our yearly trip to Seoraksan warped into my father’s futile effort to salvage a manhood I soon relinquished to ever owning. Our group by then had dwindled to a meager three: my father, my uncle, and me, following a rough divorce, an immigration to the States, and my grandfather, who was tied to Gangwon University Hospital a few kilometers away. “That's just how things are,” My uncle would say.  He would look to the sky, kissing his shot glass, and let it all out with a sigh. From a welder and a contractor, they would graduate, once a year, in the mountains, to therapists. That was the most I ever heard them talk about my grandfather’s health. 
The first funeral I ever attended belonged to him in the following months. His death by then was easy to accept and came to me as a simple matter of fact. 
I began my mourning on the last day we visited him. To think that he used to be touted as the strongest man in the house. That he killed his share of Reds during the war, and raised my father and uncle by the scruff of their neck. Only the strewn wreckage of his old appearance remained, that he did not even recognize me when I entered his room.
</p>
<p>I found it strange how he called my father by his first name. “Byoung jin ah” he regarded him for a moment before his eyes left his consciousness again. His pupils swam in a pool of yellowed white, yet they never came to look at me.
</p>
<p>He repeated a sentence that I could not decipher. The tube stuck to his mouth kept his thoughts muffled more than they already were. I gathered somewhat the first two syllables of his tune, “jaebal…” or “please,” he said. Was he asking for water? His eyes were fixed on the ceiling rather than on his firstborn son, whom he managed to recognize a moment earlier. It made me wonder if the answer to his pleading was hidden somewhere in those tiles, yet all I saw was the sterile white tone of his room. 
“Grandpa, it's me,” I spoke more for my father, who was also at a loss for words. His arms were kept crossed against his chest. None of us had the heart to touch him, as if his kind of death was contagious. “jaebal…” he said again, followed by a string of words I was trying to puzzle together. He raised a thin but heavy arm at my father. He held out his hand in the air between them, begging in his two syllables like a prayer. 
</p>
<p>“Im going for a smoke. Stay with him.” my father said. He did not waste a single distance to the door, pushing past me in a subdued rush. I took heavy steps towards him, an early preview of an open casket. I noticed a needle that sank into his bruised skin. Another series of wires and pipes, red, white, and transparent, ran out from the hem of his shirt. He weighed the consequences of each labored breath. I heard them scratch against his throat. I began to understand this was my last moment with him. My father was not one to mince or temper his words for my sake. Yet the hardened fact of my grandfather’s health only came to me once I got a proper look at him. 
</p>
<p>He was reduced to a repetition of words that not even his grandson could understand.  I did not know what to do but stare at the old man, as we then became strangers to each other.
“Please,” he reached out to me as I was the only one there. I wonder at which point he stopped being my grandfather, in all the planks and masts they fitted him with. 
I thought of what would remain of him: a silver-crowned molar, a titanium hip, a slight imprint on the hospital mattress. The final remnants of Theseus’ ship. A ball joint obelisk in the cremated desert of his urn. 
</p>
<p> “Please, don’t take me away, God.” The words made sense to me. Part of me always assumed I would die in my sleep or in a sudden but painless car crash. When that day comes, that I would have the grace and wisdom of age by my side. 
</p>
<p>My uncle walked in. he was younger than my father by three years yet it was at times difficult to tell them apart. ”Seung!” he said. We were not ones to hug in our household. “It's nice of you to take charge for once. The frog extracts are finally turning you into a proper man.” He spoke with an inflection on every other syllable, that it always took me a second to process him. It was a proud Gangwon dialect that my father forgot upon moving to Seoul in his youth. My mother joked about how he used to be a country bumpkin, yet I could always tell that he was ashamed of this loss. My uncle told me to get my father for him, which was an improvement over staying in the room. 
</p>
<p>I pictured them together, each at a different stage of evolution. One resembling the other, yet their features magnified with time. Defiant brows, a height to match, and a widow’s peak by thirty.  I thought of the creases of their skin. Not of worry or concern, but a permanent frown that sank deep into their face. My grandfather kept his signature Park family scowl even on his deathbed. They reminded me of janseung poles that were meant to scare away evil spirits from a village. They were as hard as wood and loomed over me with a threatening expression carved onto their face.
</p>
<p>Then I caught a reflection of myself through a tinted window of the hospital. I wore a harsh slouch as if I was meant to walk on my fours. My uncle would say I resembled the small frogs we ate in the mountains. This would follow with a blunt slap on my back, as if his hands were a hammer, and I was a junk piece of metal to flatten. 
</p>
<p>My father’s hands were no different. They were bare and closed-fisted, or bone white, clenching a belt when he was too tired to speak. A skin of an animal instead of his own. For he reminds me, I was not his son but a dog’s. It was fitting for a tradesman to strike while the iron was young. Yet with every hand that came to me, he failed to pass on his genes. It would only echo a kinder era of cold fingers and soft, callused palms that never held my own again.</p>
<p>To use an animal to make a man. I wonder if he saw the same irony. He took the idea to heart when my age began to run past my height. He looked to his province for an answer, believing whatever was wrong within me had to do with the city. “Your food is dead long before it even reaches the table,” he used to say while cradling a full stomach.  Our yearly visit would then include a check-up by a traditional medicine slinger who owned a modest practice next to the Jumunjin wet market. It never dawned on my father to question how anyone could be called a doctor for owning a white coat and a pair of round glasses. They operated by word of mouth, passed on between relatives and friends like Joseon court physicians who served on the same royal bloodline. “Doctor Han fixed your grandfather’s back,” my father said on our first appointment when I was eleven. “Let’s see if he can do something  about you.”
</p>
<p>It was always something to do with my heart. I remember my sister telling me that day, the faint beating which pulsed within my ears when I ran, or cried, or got mad, was not a heart but a frog that hopped from fear within my chest. Like a deep family secret, she said that no one held me after I was born. Not my mother, and surely not him. “The doctor advised to cook you for a while longer and threw you in the incubator,” she said. “He even tried slapping you, but you wouldn't budge.” So I lay in the oven, my first human contact being a cupped palm against my back. And there I was born a heartless infant, but for the frog I kept close to my chest. </p>
<p>Doctor Han, placing an icy stethoscope on my chest, clicked his tongue in agreement with my father’s diagnosis. “Something is wrong with your adeunim’s heart.” My father was very pleased with the way he addressed me with honorifics. I noticed an awkward bloom from his wrinkled frown. It was as if he had starved himself until then and finally gotten a chance to own a proper son. </p>
<p>Yet I held my breath expectantly for my father to say I was fine. It was a cruel way to describe his son. Man, human, or not. My chest bare, I waited for the sturdy words that could’ve freed me from my shame. Instead, they uttered about a faintness, a diet, and a disfigured personality. They listed details about me like they were reading out of a biology textbook. 
I looked behind the doctor’s table. An entire wall of polished wooden drawers with classical Chinese characters engraved on their fronts. There were no diplomas and Latin honors. Those were his accolades, the cubby holes filled with dead animals: sun-dry, fine powder, and balms. “Nok-yong,” I read one of them aloud. Nok meant dear. It was something I learned in grade school, along with the other characters in Aesop's fables.  But I blanked on the yong or rong, which I vaguely recall describing a peach fuzz. 
</p>
<p>“I harvest them young. While their horns are with velvet,” Doctor Han said. He handed me a thin, petal-like piece. I tried to ignore the red stain that ran from the middle of the leaf. It was as light as it looked, yet there was a weight to it that I could never forget.
He told my father that my medicine would be something more potent. That it was not in one of the many holes he decorated with animals. 
</p>
<p>He ushered us through a narrow flight of stairs that led to a humid basement. It was smaller than the office upstairs, and it smelled of dirt and summer. There were no windows, but warm bulbs that lit the room to a late afternoon. I saw in that basement rows of seafood tanks that I would normally find in the wet market. As I took a closer look at them, I noticed they were filled with frogs, each as big as my father’s fists. They were brown, green, and scattered with imperfect spots that resembled dead leaves in autumn. There was an odd harmony in their movement. They were calm and only reacted to the touch of another like a collective wave. I felt my own frog within my chest, thrashing its legs at their sight. It was hard to distinguish between my fear and its guilt.</p>
<p>Doctor Han covered himself with a pink dishwashing glove as if he were a surgeon. He grabbed one of the bigger, slower ones and showed it to my father. It broke out a chaos in the tank. I saw them multiply by the hundreds before my eyes, yet they were nothing against the steel mesh lid, weighted by the two bricks. 
</p>
<p>“Bull frogs, Gangwon natives like you.” The doctor said. “Look how this one’s still fighting in my hand. I use these to make the strongest frog extracts in the country.” He tossed the frog back into the tank as if it were a stone.</p>
<p>He talked about his process of cooking them live until they are liquified to the bone to capture their vitality.  This was followed by a catalog of medicinal herbs all across Asia, south and east, that I had never heard of before. </p>
<p>He asked my father if we were football fans, and if he watched Park Jisung score against Arsenal the other night. A low-hanging fruit, he latched onto the doctor’s words in the very next second. “I never lie to my patients. It goes against my practice. So believe me when I tell you that these frogs in my tank are first cousins of the ones prescribed to Jisungee.”  The Doctor spoke as if he knew the player personally.  
</p>
<p>It had become common knowledge that Park Jisung, heralded as Korea’s pride, grew up taking frog extracts following a reality program that featured the soccer player’s life. He asked if I wanted to try a sample. Before I could protest, he picked up a plastic-sealed pouch from the fridge that stood in the corner of the room. 
</p>
<p>I could feel the thickness of the liquid within the black pouch. It had a traditional print of a tiger with a frog between its fangs. It gave off an opal hue, as if to emulate the mother-of-pearl patterns inlaid in traditional jagejang wardrobes. It only ended up looking like a cheap holographic trading card. 
I felt then, the same unforgettable weight on my hands, as if to account for each frog that melted into brown liquid medicine. I wondered if, at a certain point, there was a perfect temperature between lukewarm and boiling, where the frogs could close their eyes and bask in the propane warmth beneath them. I tried to recall the herbs and roots that went along with their cooking. I hoped that one of those many leaves reminded them of their mountain home. 
</p>
<p>“This is liquid gold,” my father said. “If any of it spills out of your mouth, I'm going to-” he stopped himself in consideration of the doctor. I fumbled with clammy hands before he had to open it for me. 
</p>
<p>I tried to down it all in a single, mighty gulp. The taste, it felt as if I had fallen on my face, as cold mud was forced into my mouth. I did not feel the foreign herbs the doctor mentioned, and the apparent vitality captured in every pouch was lost somewhere in the vacuum of my senses.</p>
<p>A family tree of frogs. I had broken a branch and forced a generational massacre down my stomach. I felt them kick and flail, and in a single moment, I felt it all. An eternity of genes being traded back and forth, in service of evolution and metamorphosis. Yet their fatal flaw was ambition: Leaping too high as if to reach the sun, though their spines could never arch to look at the sky. Buried within the filth of their siblings, in tanks under a basement. And now, they found their peace inside a plastic pouch.  Father, mother, and sister mixed together in a mass grave.
If only they were weak like me, or if only I were as strong. 
</p>
<p>The sensation was something I could never get used to. Each morning, he would make sure that I took the frog medicine, and it would fill me with a numbness he could never find in his bottle of soju. It wasn’t the kind that made me fall deep into sleep, but one that would ring for hours in my head. Its muggy taste of the earth would trigger my chest to expand, to throw up, yet doing so would mean a swift backhand. My mind would slip into hibernation, and each time I woke, I’d find pieces of myself missing. 
</p>
<p>All this effort to fill up a hole in my weak heart. No, in his. A hole in the shape of his very own: Project Park Jisung. </p>
<p>I searched for him in the lobby of the hospital, tracing my steps to the parking lot, and taking the elevator back to my grandfather’s room. I thought of waiting for him there, but considered the disappointment my uncle would wear on his face and spit on mine.</p>
<p>“You can’t even find your own father?” I could almost hear him say. I also could not bear the foreboding discomfort I felt in that room. I felt as if a boulder was headed towards me, in the form of the sickness that took hold of my grandfather. I was never given the courtesy of knowing what that sickness was. Or what it entailed, except that he had lost his mind and that he was going to die. My grandfather was not one to lose things. Not his reading glasses, not even my number against the tiny keypads on his flip phone. He said he was born in that era when people could not afford to lose anything. And suddenly, all at once, I was to believe he had lost his mind, and soon his life would follow. 
</p>
<p>This reminded me of my health class teacher who talked about how wrong it was for people above his age to be alive. That medicine had first caught up to and soon ran past our natural mortality. The moral of it was to keep up with our age and always brush our teeth. Yet he taught us nothing of keeping our minds healthy so they may grow old in tandem with the body. I thought of my own mind. The different feelings I came to lose over the years. Or were they still with me, frozen in hibernation? 
I rushed a glance at my grandfather’s room. He remained in repetition and my uncle looked as if he was moments from tears. 
</p>
<p>Every wire buried within was no longer a foreign object but had become a part of my grandfather. To pull one out would mean to lose a lung or a different essential organ.
Death by time and decay, I thought. The boulder had crushed parts of him and was on a slow, tortuous tilt. This was the very first fight he had ever lost. And soon, I thought,  my dad and uncle, as echoes of my grandfather, would follow. 
</p>
<p>My mind and body, husband and wife. I’d rather let them die together than have one, long for the other. With open arms, I’d run towards that boulder and I’d pray that it would roll past me in a single instant. 
</p>
<p>I decided to wait, away from wet eyes and pleading voices, in the emergency exit a floor below. 
I went down and there I found my father,  a round-shouldered monolith, obstructing my path. There was no way for me to tell what he was doing without a cigarette trail shrouding his head. His back was turned against me, sitting in the middle of the steps. It was an odd position to see him in. I had countless words in the chamber of my mind to describe him. He was angry, violent, harsh, and fragile in so many other destructive ways. But until that moment, odd was never part of that description. I saw his torso rise and fall between smokeless breaths. I watched him struggle as if to hold it all in. That was the noise of someone ashamed of crying. 
</p>
<p>It was clumsy, another word I thought to never associate with him. He cried with his old Gangwon dialect. stumbling in between, as if trying to remember a long-forgotten language from his childhood. I tried to understand how he felt when I cried in front of him. He never taught me then, the words to console a man. </p>
<p>So I stood back,  a safe distance behind him. The frog jumped restless in my chest. Yet it was not out of sympathy. It was a matter of instinct that I was not supposed to be there. He must’ve sensed me as he stood up to his usual totem pole stature. I was empty but for the thin shred of fear that remained awake despite the medicine. The frog clung on to it and screamed in booming echoes within my body. I felt it shake me, and it was the only other thing I could do but look up at my father. He wore his family scowl. Yet his hardened expression from his years of manual labor soaked into a red, swollen frown. “Not a word of this to your uncle,” he said.
</p>
<p>He looked at me as if expecting a reaction. A Dunhill stuck to the moisture of his inner lip, he was then a wick waiting for a spark. He looked for an ember to ignite him, a reason for him to hit me. He’d rather show me his fists, again and again, over his tears. It was as if he had gotten a taste of his mortality, yet unlike his father, he would not have a son to mourn him. His cigarette only looked like a pacifier. And when I had no words to give, we let that moment die in that staircase just as he left it, unclaimed and never to be spoken of. 
</p>

  
<p>My father refused to break tradition even after his outburst.
We arrived at the campsite in the early evening. Our last hike to one of Seoraksan’s inner summits was years ago. Weaker knees and tired backs only took to shorter and easier trails. 
I began to detach from these pointless trips my father imposed on me year after year. Not once has it shaped me, even slightly, into a man. I felt only great discomfort in spending an entire weekend with him. Every movement of his arm made me flinch, and I would sift through his words, as if to find his anger within them. 
</p>
<p>Our trail to the campsite was just a short thirty-minute walk from the park entrance. I wore a near empty trekking backpack he had given me years ago, and lugged with two hands, a red plastic bucket with scattered holes knifed into its lid. The shallow water inside kept shifting the bucket’s weight, yet I tried to keep it steady so as not to startle the frogs. Our dinner. A sudden realization struck me a moment earlier that afternoon. I had been so distracted by it and nearly spilled everything on the graying rubber carpet of my uncle’s truck. 
</p>
<p>In his apartment, as we prepared for the trip, I was left alone as the two of them stepped out to buy instant noodles and soju.  I warmed myself against the heated vinyl floor, knowing that the rest of my time would be spent frozen in the mountains. 
Underneath my uncle's couch, I found a stack of Playboys alongside a catalog of other adult magazines. It was a dusty United Nations’ mock debate with every country I could think of stacked above each other.  At the very forefront, I looked at the American woman in the Playboys edition. She was but paper, and both of our gazes were indifferent to each other. 
</p>
<p>All the emotions that I knew I should’ve had were left unfelt. The frog slept. I knew this foreign model to be beautiful, but it came to me as nothing more than a piece of information. I looked upon each of these attractive women, unfurling them from their glossy pages, begging that I would feel something, begging and pounding my chest for the frog to awaken. It felt absurd, a desire for desire. 
I only understood their beauty to be out of place under the pullout frame of my uncle’s room. I wondered what possessed him to keep a physical paper receipt of his desire. Was his lust driven by nostalgia?
</p>
<p>I was still confused and searching for my own degree of wanting. Of passion, longing, or even hatred. But I felt nothing close to human. He always saw an animal in me. So I might as well have been a bullfrog all along. Ever since he wanted me to capture their vitality. Or one of the many mountain frogs in the red bucket, as I felt their cold indifference to it all. </p>
<p>I looked around the camp. It was just the three of us guided by a few lamps. If I took a step back, I’d melt right into the darkness. I’d find myself a year later, among the docile frogs, swimming in lakes and sleeping through long Decembers. 
</p>
<p>My father slotted a butane canister in the stove’s compartment. A practiced movement, like loading a shotgun shell. A ring fire blinked awake after a few clicks. Its color shared the same tone of blue as the eyes of one of the models. 
</p>
<p>He placed a wire grill above it and opened a bottle of soju while waiting for it to heat. I watched him hold three shot glasses with his left hand and fill them to the brim in a single motion. 
“To our father,” he said. It was the first time he’d spoken a word to me since the hospital.
“Geonbae!” they said, and I received a hard slap on my back. Even affection was only through masculinity. 
</p>
<p>He dug out a steel doshirak basin from his pack, slightly overlapping the edges of his hand, and made a shallow pool with the soju. They wore matching cotton working gloves. The only cooking utensil they were familiar with. Their hands disappeared inside the red bucket. My father grabbed a mountain frog and bathed it top and bottom with the soju. It did not put up a fight. From tempering fire, harnessing rebars and concrete, his fingers were heatproof as he pressed it against the grill. The frog, he held his arms together on his cream colored belly. “This one's just a boy like you,” my uncle said. He told me once that the male frogs would try to hug their wives as they died in the fire. Those were merely involuntary mechanisms of muscles and proteins unraveling beneath his skin. 
</p>
<p>The mountain frog looked at me with his bead eyes. And I looked down, feeling more for him than any of the women who beckoned at me in the magazine. I broke contact as I was ashamed to be sitting between my uncle and father. To think that I ever tried to be like them. To think that I tried to be a man. Slowly, the frame lashed over him, and he began to shrink and cocoon himself. He lacked fat. He evaporated out of his body, and he held himself even tighter as if trying to revert to his younger years as a limbless tadpole. And all together, the blue fire licked his face, gaunt of his youth, until my father deemed him safe for consumption. The frog succumbed under the weight of his thumb, and my father finished him in two bites. There must have been an unspoken practice to devour every part of them, whether they liquified or charred. 
</p>
<p>My uncle placed his frog on the fire, and he held it there a moment longer than my father. A petty show of strength that would’ve caused a fight in their youth. This one did not struggle as well. The sheen of their red rubber-dipped gloves caught the dim light. It was the blood in their hands, which the frogs could never shed atop the fire. “This one must be a girl,” my uncle pointed at her crimson stomach and her arms that spread. They did that as if to let their children go. </p>
<p>I felt an immense pain radiating from my amphibian heart, and there I also saw a dignified beauty in the way they died. Not once did they kick or flail against the red hands that came to grab them. Not once did they cry, nor bargain different parts of themselves just to live a day longer. They knew it was futile. They knew of pain as nothing but a sensation that would pass. They were aware of death, so all they asked for was a final act. To express a yearning for their loved ones to be free, or to embrace them through the agony.
</p>
<p>After years remaining dormant, I found my desire in the charred body of my kind. I stood up and a pair of eyes, younger and older, looked at me. They regarded me with confusion and a simmering anger. They blurred and softened against mine as they held no candle to the frog’s. An Exodus, I tilted the bucket, making sure the frogs would not bruise and they drummed and rained out.  Their deaths, whether on that very evening or a year later, were on their term.</p>
<p>It took a few seconds for my father to register what I had done. He swung the basin at me. It was a passing moment, I thought to myself. He swung again, and I held my arms against my chest, not as a man but as one of the male frogs. In the end, it was a passing moment. Nothing more than a sensation. No different from the shirt that rested on my shoulder, nor the blades of grass that pricked and tickled me.
